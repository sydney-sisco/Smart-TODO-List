## Presentation 

# Introduction (R: Connie)
* Say hi and introduce everyone's name // login as everyone is getting introduced 
* Why we chose this project: wanted something seemingly simple but also challenging so that we could focus on implementing many stretch features (also because I refused to do the quiz app jkjk)

# Main features (R: Connie) 
* Smart To-do list that auto-categorizes your to-dos into watch, eat, read, buy or general categories
* Main sorting algorithm leverages google search & google natural language apis
* Also used other APIs such as google-books, yelp, amazon, imdb, and moviedb for some special features

Segway: LET'S GET SORTING! 

Demo: 
1) Add a couple of items to the list, then choose 1 of each watch, eat, read, buy to show the details card)
(If you type more than one thing)
2) Input error (maybe if there's time)

When something gets mis-categorized, hand over to next person for stretch features

# Stretch Demo (R: Syd)
1) Change the category of the mis-categorized item -> show the new details card
2) Change the name of the item -> show the new details card
3) Complete items -> Toggle the done list
4) Change priority of the item
5) Mobile view

# Future Features V2 (R: Syd)
* Allow users to create their own categories/implement more categories

# UI (R: Sam) Switch to dark mode
* Also no one likes having their eyes burned off -> show-off dark mode (using local storage)
* Everything you'd ever need in a normal to-do's list so kept everything simple from a design standpoint

# Closing Remarks (R: Sam)
* Tricky in the beginning figuring out the workflow (picking things that don't conflict), but once we got going, we were able to accomplish a lot ... like A LOT 
* Had merge conflicts, used pull requests instead, but merging wasn't too bad when we worked togetha
* Finding a good free API one was tough (ones that are reliable and fast)
* Mention Heroku hosting (hashing passwords but mention dont actually used something real)
* Say thank you with confetti
